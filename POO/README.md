# Is Go an object-oriented language?
Yes and no. Althoigh go has types and methods and allows an object-oriented style of programming, there
is no type hierarchy. The concept of "interface" in go provides a different approach that we believe is easy 
to use and in some ways more general. There are also ways to embed types in other types to provide something analogous
but not identical—to subclassing. Moreover, methods in Go are more general than in C++ or Java: they can be 
defined for any sort of data, even built-in types such as plain, “unboxed” integers. They are not restricted to structs (classes).

Also, the lack of a type hierarchy makes “objects” in Go feel much more lightweight than in languages such as C++ or Java.

## The struct 
In go, instead of java and c++ classes, the equivalent container for encapsulation is called a 
`struct`. It describes the attributes of the objects for this class. A struct looks 
like this: 
```golang
    type Animal struct {
        Name string
        canFly bool
    }

    // You can instantiate is as follows:
    anAnimal := Animal{Name: "Lion", canFly: false}
    fmt.println(anAnimal.Name)
```
